/**
 * Main menu option 1 - play the game as per the specification.
 *
 * This function makes all the calls to board & player and handles interaction
 * with the user (reading input from the console, error checking, etc...).
 *
 * It should be possible to break this function down into smaller functions -
 * but this is up to you to decide and is entirely your own design. You can
 * place the additional functions in this header file if you want.
 *
 * Note that if you don't break this function up it could become pretty big...
 * and marks are allocated to good coding practices.
