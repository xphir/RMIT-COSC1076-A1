Advantages:
	Easier to debug your program as you can track down where certain tasks are performed
	You only write the functionality for each task in one place
	High level functions such as main are easier to read as they are made up of problem
	domain function calls
	If you write small functions you often isolate bugs to a single function

Disadvantages:
	Breaking down your programs into smaller functions requires greater planning than having
	larger functions
	Function calls take time – each function call requires the pushing of the parameters onto
	the stack, followed by the return address. You then need to jump to the location of the function
	in memory (and back to the return address when the function is finished)
	Local variables inside a function are no longer available when you return from that function
